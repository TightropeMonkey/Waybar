Credits to Alexays for developing the Waybar (https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) and the media player integration!

I just have added a small integration to push the Spotify current song as a Mattermost custom status.

## Features

For me it was important, that all metadata from various players are displayed in the Waybar but only in case of Spotify, the metadata is set as Mattermost status.




## Configuration

Change the global variables mmserver and mmcookiedb inside the mediaplayer.py file to your own values.
